Ion Variant Hunter README
Feb. 2012
v. 0.1.2

Ion Variant Hunter is a unified variant caller, that uses flow intensities and alignments based
on bases and base counts (aka flowgram).

Variant Hunter produces both SNPs and InDels, but note that the Torrent Server variant
caller plugin only uses the InDel calls from this software.

For building the lisp component (ion-variant-hunter-core):
Requires sbcl to be installed.  Specific sbcl version used for TS 2.0.x was sbcl-1.0.51.

Modifications to sbcl used while building can be found in this package at
public/lisp/sbcl-mod/

For development, one can use slime with emacs. Both are available packages in Ubuntu 10.04.

For the java component (SamToFlowSpace.jar):
Download sam-1.57.jar and picard-1.57.jar and place them in a folder
called lib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/picard/files/picard-tools/1.57/picard-tools-1.57.zip/download).
