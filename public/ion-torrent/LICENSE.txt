License: A mixture of BSD-style (for a few subsystems) and public domain (for the rest of the system).


SBCL
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SBCL is derived from CMU CL, and carries the same licensing terms, a mixture of BSD-style (for a few subsystems) and public domain (for the rest of the system).

Some of the files in CMU CL have a BSD-style license requiring that credit be given to the institutions which owned the copyright to the original versions: Xerox, Inc., the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Symbolics, Inc., and Gerd Moellmann. For these files, SBCL necessarily uses the same BSD-style license as CMU CL did.

The rest of the files in SBCL (as in CMU CL) are in the public domain. The boilerplate at the beginning of SBCL source files looks like this:

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is
;;;; provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS
;;;; files for more information.

The COPYING file discusses further the particular licenses of parts of SBCL, whereas CREDITS details individual contributions.
